# Analyzing New York City highschool data

In this project, I investigate correlations between SAT (Scholastic Aptitude Test) scores and demographics like race, gender, income, and more.

This project was a 'guided project' as part of learning data analytics with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io).
